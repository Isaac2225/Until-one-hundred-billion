# Until-one-hundred-billion

The goal of this game is to reach the impressive figure of '100000000000' by holding down a key.  
Sounds tedious, right? Spoiler, it is. But in the 'buy upgrades' option, you can purchase some upgrades to make the journey to one hundred billion more enjoyable. To buy these upgrades, you'll need points that you accumulate each time you reach a multiple of '100', such as '100', '200', '300'...  
WARNING:

If you try to buy something without the necessary points, not only will you not be able to, but you will also be penalized by losing the upgrade. Play strategically to be the fastest in reaching one hundred billion!

#ATENTION
My conio is not a real c library. Is java's JANSI adapted to C.
You have to download all the project if you want the game to work correctly.

#DISCLAIMER
